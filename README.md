## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS positioning
- Mobile-first workflow

### Decisions


I took the desicion to use Mobile-first workflow, it was because I think this type of page applies better into mobile than desktop, I think it's look a little empty into the desktop version.

I made some plans about how I would apply things and then I just needed to implement it, it made the code flow a lot faster than I tought.

I made this page using just what I already knew about CSS and HTML, based on that, you will see that I took the decision to use CSS position properties instead of CSS grid or flex layout, why that? Well, how it's just and element on the entire body of the site, I tought that it would fit well, a simple way to put things into place, and how it's just one element, I don't need to worry about breaking the layout.

About the responsible part of the page, well, I didn't needed to make any change into the layout to the desktop version, cause the position propertiers already do the job to put the things on place based on view size.
